# GitHub_Fetch

It was a really good practice to make this small web app - how to get data from an API using Axios library, 
how to handle incidental errors which may occur during fetching. In this case I used GitHub API. 
Just type the GitHub username into the search field then press Enter to get the main details of the user 
info and the latest 7 repositores.
